# HANDMADE-PRODUCTS-WEBSITE
A shopping website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Asp.net. The Website makes the user can sell and buy handmade products.
# The Idea
Many people struggle with the inability to share and sell their handmade Products on social media. Moreover, if they make their own page on social media, not all people are going to know them so most of them may give up because the activation on their page is not good. The idea is to make a business out of hobbies of knitting, crocheting, and handicrafts. Our aim is to create a platform that helps women who knit and crochet to display their products and get profit from them. Parallel to that the company would offer crochet products that are practical and look nice in order to show that crochet can be incorporated into almost everything and can look modern and funky. The Website makes the user register and logs in first then he can add or buy a product. Our Project has two features. The first one, the user can add a Product and the product will be published on the website The second option, is for the user can buy the product and select the quantity he wants to buy. After that, the information of the product will be added to the cart. The website has a Navigator menu so the user can choose the home page, log in, Register, add products, and know about us from it.
