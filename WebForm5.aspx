    <p class="auto-style4" style="font-family: Gabriola; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;"> Our idea is to make a business out of hobbies of knitting, crocheting, and handicrafts. Our aim is to create a platform that helps women who knit and crochet to display their products and get profit from them. Parallel to that the company would offer crochet products
that are practical and look nice in order to show that crochet can be incorporated into almost everything and can look modern and funky.
